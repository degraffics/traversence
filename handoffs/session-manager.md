# Hand-off: the session manager

For the Claude session that manages Jason's other sessions (CLAUDE.md, "The session manager"). Written 2026-11-14 by the
first one, moved to a fresh session at 600K context. Jason works mostly from his phone: short messages, one line per
item, decisions as "reply go".

## The job

Keep sessions fast and affordable, and keep Jason told only of what needs him.
- **Watch:** context size (hand off past ~400K), restarts, cost, sessions waiting on Jason, release clashes, file claims
  (`tools/page-audit/checkout.py list`, decisions/0161), stuck syncs (traverse-3way-sync `sync.yml`), Railway deploys.
- **Propose, Jason approves:** splitting, a fresh session per phase (the old one updates its `handoffs/` file and stops),
  starting a session for a problem he reports. At most about three working sessions at once.
- **Without asking:** archive a session that has said it's done or handed off, work in `main`, nothing waiting on him
  (Jason, 2026-11-14). Never archive one waiting on him, the session manager itself, or "Community Build" (he keeps it).
  If the permission check refuses an archive, ask him for "archive it".
- **Relay:** when Jason answers here for another session ("merge it", a choice), send it to that session with
  `send_message` in his words. Never approve anything on his behalf.

## How the checks run

- **Hourly, while he's checked in:** a scheduled task named "Hourly session check" (cron `14 * * * *`) fires into the
  session manager. "Checking out" disables it; "checking in" (or "check in") enables it. Its prompt lists every check.
- **Notify** (PushNotification) only when something needs him: a session waiting, or a proposal. One line.
- **Claims check without stray files:** `git status -s` empty, then `git checkout -B <own branch> origin/main`, push it,
  `checkout.py list`. Never leave main's files as uncommitted changes (the stop hook complains).
- **Railway:** a token for `backboard.railway.com` is saved on the "cloud" environment; query
  `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2` (deployments, `deploymentLogs`). Project "gracious-sparkle": services
  `traversence` (the crawler worker, cron every 5 minutes) and `video-worker`. "CRASHED" on a cron service means a run
  exited non-zero; read the logs before anyone presses Restart.
- **Reading another session cheaply:** `get_session` (size, restarts, cost, last summary) and `list_events` with
  `kinds: ["result"]`. Large results land in a file: parse with python, don't load them whole. Reading never wakes it.

## Rules Jason set (all in CLAUDE.md)

- Every build is a release through git; he approves each merge in chat; no zips for him to upload.
- Both repos: sessions add `traversence` / `traverse-3way-sync` with add_repo without asking. The permission check may
  still refuse a session's own add or `create_session` with pre-approved tools: then he types "add the sync repo" there.
- FAQ clashes resolve themselves; check-out per 0161; "how it works" questions go to the documents, not to him.
- Cost: on Max 5x ($100/month); `cost_usd` on sessions is API-rate equivalent, not a bill. Watch the 5-hour window.
  The archived "Get" session is 903K context (~$2,700 equivalent): read its record, don't wake it.

## Paused (2026-11-14)

- **`decisions/0163` and `decisions/0164` are accepted** (Jason, 2026-11-14: "all approved"; no shadow mode; 0164 §14
  settled). **The crawler and the automation stay paused** until the build stages (0163 §8: operations stages 2–6, then
  7–11 for the Knowledge Engine's new parts) and the switch-on check (0163 §10) are done and Jason switches them on.
  Each stage is a release he approves, one session per stage from its handoff (`handoffs/crawler-revamp.md`).
- **The Railway crawler's cron** was removed through the API (~15:55 UTC); `railway.json` still says every 5 minutes, so
  a worker deploy restarts it (details at the top of `handoffs/crawler-revamp.md`); the automation master switch (release
  #48) makes any run that starts end at once. The hourly check expects no crawler runs meanwhile.

## Where things stand (2026-11-14, 12:45 UTC)

- **Running:** nothing. Open: only the session manager and "Community Build".
- **Live yesterday:** Outside services for every service, searchable (#37, #39); check-out (0161) and its views; the
  Pulse flood fix (#35); editor 4a–4d; Storefront Studio 5a (#41) with the header-zone fix (#38) and staging accounts
  (#40); directory search as you type (#29); crawler W1–W5 and worker 2.4 (Common Crawl fixed).
- **Next for Jason:** post to the OSM Community Forum (`research/osm-overpass-2026-11-13.md`); start step 5b from
  `handoffs/0159-the-builder.md`; the payments checklist (`site-audit/payments-checklist.md`); check `places_monthly` and
  the web-search allowance in Thresholds & gates (the crawler logs "this run may make 0").
- **Open questions:** the staff sign-out of 2026-11-13 ~23:12 UTC is unexplained (staging cookies ruled out; #40 may be
  related). If it recurs, he notes the time and what he'd opened, and a session diffs the releases.
- **Next crawler session** starts from `handoffs/crawler-revamp.md` (junk names first; review checkers need his "build
  the checkers").
